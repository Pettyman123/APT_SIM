# APT Simulation Tool

---

### Overview
The APT Simulation Tool replicates the behavior of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) within a controlled environment. This project helps cybersecurity professionals test and enhance their detection and response strategies against sophisticated cyber-attacks.

---

### Key Features
- **Lateral Movement Simulation**: Mimics attacker techniques for network traversal.
- **Persistence Mechanisms**: Simulates methods to maintain unauthorized access.
- **Data Exfiltration**: Replicates data extraction via HTTPS, FTP, and more.
- **Modular Configuration**: Easily customizable APT simulations through config files.
- **Detailed Logging**: Provides comprehensive logs for analysis and security improvement.

---

### Getting Started
1. **Setup**: Build and run the simulation environment using Docker or Vagrant.
2. **Configuration**: Modify the `apt_config.json` file to select APT techniques to simulate.
3. **Execution**: Run the simulation and analyze the results through logs.

---

### Future Scope
- **Enhanced Techniques**: Incorporate advanced APT methods.
- **SIEM Integration**: Connect with SIEM systems for real-time monitoring.
- **UI Development**: Create a user-friendly interface for managing simulations.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Expand support to include Linux, macOS, and Windows.
